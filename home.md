Hello! I am Anjolaoluwa Popoola, a postdoctoral research scholar at the [Tippie College of Business](https://tippie.uiowa.edu), University of Iowa. My research interests lie in developing machine learning (ML) methodologies and algorithms to solve prevalent challenges in healthcare and social welfare. Specifically, I aim to build and utilize novel machine learning techniques to tackle prevalent issues such as high dimensional data challenges and predictions in these fields.

I recently received my Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu), Georgia Institute of Technology, where my thesis focused on exploring novel ML methodologies to address pressing problems across multiple domains: correcting measurement errors in dietary data to enable accurate diet-disease studies, designing dynamic deep learning and Kalman filter models for real-time blood glucose prediction, and developing predictive frameworks to assess the risk of homelessness among foster care youth.
