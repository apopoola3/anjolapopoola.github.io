Hello! I am Anjolaoluwa Popoola, a fourth year PhD student at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu), Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests lie in developing machine learning (ML) methodologies and algorithms to solve prevalent challenges in healthcare and social welfare. Specifically, I aim to build and utilize novel machine learning techniques to tackle prevalent issues such as high dimensional data challenges and predictions in these fields.

I’m particularly passionate about projects that have real-world impact, and have worked on projects such as improving dietary data for public health insights using machine learning methods, utilizing deep learning and dynamic systems modeling to create predictive models for glucose management in diabetic patients, and designing data driven optimization methodologies to reduce homelessness among foster care youth. In the future, I hope to use my knowledge in ML to tackle more issues in healthcare, social welfare and other sectors. 

I am also very passionate about teaching and mentoring. At Georgia Tech, I’ve served as a guest lecturer and teaching assistant in courses like High-Dimensional Data Analytics and Probability with Applications. My goal is to foster a thriving learning environment where students can connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications,and grow through collaboration. Additionally, I am dedicated to service and have volunteered at the Data Science for Social Good program, served as a mentor for the George Fellows Leadership Program, and vice president of the Georgia Tech INFORMS chapter.
