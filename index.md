Hello! I am Anjolaoluwa Popoola, a fourth year PhD candidate at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu), Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests lie in developing machine learning (ML) methodologies and algorithms to solve prevalent challenges in healthcare and social welfare. Specifically, I aim to build and utilize novel machine learning techniques to tackle prevalent issues such as high dimensional data challenges and predictions in these fields.
